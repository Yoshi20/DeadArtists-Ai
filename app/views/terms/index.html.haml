      We will not be liable or responsible to the you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of these Terms, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from a Force Majeure Event. For purposes of these Terms, a “Force Majeure Event” shall mean any one or more of the following events beyond the reasonable control of either party: (i) an act of God or public enemy; (ii) war (declared or undeclared); (iii) sabotage; rebellion; riot; act(s) or threatened act(s) of terrorism, civil commotion; (iv) labor dispute of any kind or nature; (v) embargo; (vi) natural and/or man-made disaster (e.g., fire, flood, earthquake, landslide, tornado, hurricane, blizzard, volcanic eruption, tsunami, storm, drought, explosion and the like); (vii) natural or man-made epidemic/pandemic (inclusive without limitation of COVID-19; viral outbreaks; public health crises; and/or global health emergencies) and their resulting governmental action, societal restrictions, and/or curtailment or closure of any means of travel, modes of public transit, and/or common carriers); (viii) casualty and/or death; (ix) act(s) of any federal, state, and/or local instrumentality, including, but not limited to, any restriction, declaration, regulation and/or any other action or order that may impact travel, movement, large gatherings, and/or the entertainment industry; (x) the failure, scarcity, or unavailability of necessary equipment, utilities, and other resources (similar or dissimilar); and/or (xi) for any reason with similar consequences, foreseeable or unforeseeable.

      %strong 16. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver

      You agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and the BCL Parties, regarding any aspect of your relationship with the BCL Parties, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.  Each of you and the BCL Parties agree to give up the right to sue in court.

      The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and the BCL Parties, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory. The term “Dispute” specifically includes, but is not limited to, any disputes, actions, claims, or controversies between you and the BCL Parties that arise from or in any way relate to or concern any products or services provided by the BCL Parties including but not limited to the Services (as defined above), the Dead Artists NFTs, the Additional NFTs, this Arbitration Agreement, any other aspect of these Terms (including their applicability and their conformance to applicable law), any billing disputes, and any disputes relating to telephonic, text message, or any other communications either of us received from the other.  The only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (a) each of you and the BCL Parties retain the right to sue in small claims court and (b) each of you and the BCL Parties may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.  Disputes over whether these exceptions apply shall be resolved by the court in which such action has been brought; all other disputes over arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator.

      Each of you and the BCL Parties also agree to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you.

      There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  An arbitrator must follow these Terms.  The arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages) provided that they are recoverable under these Terms.

      These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms.

      Any arbitration between you and the BCL Parties will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective June 1, 2021 (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator, and if you and the BCL Parties involved cannot agree on who that single arbitrator will be, the arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the JAMS Rules.  The JAMS Rules are available on its website at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.  The Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/.  The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.

      If either you or a BCL Party wants to arbitrate a claim, you or that BCL Party must first send by mail and email to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.  Your Notice to the BCL Party must be sent by mail and email to: Fox Corporation, 10201 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90064, BCLNotices@fox.com.  The involved BCL Party will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide, if any.  It is the sender’s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.  During the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.

      If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Rules.  Further instructions on submitting a Demand for Arbitration may be found at http://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf.   In addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration with JAMS in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to Fox at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.

      (i) YOU AND THE BCL PARTIES MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHERS ONLY IN YOUR OR THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (ii) the involved BCL Parties will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with this Section; (iii) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law and these Terms; and (iv) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided in this Section.

      JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations.  Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against a BCL Party, you and the BCL Party acknowledge and agree to abide by the following: (i) If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), the involved BCL Party will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it; (ii) if you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but the involved BCL Party will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator; (iii) the BCL Parties and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys’ fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing. The BCL Parties will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000.  This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules; (iv) the BCL Parties and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.

      Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and the involved BCL Party shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions, which will be part of the arbitration award and admissible in any judicial proceeding to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.

      Each of you and the involved BCL Party may incur attorneys’ fees during the arbitration.  Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys’ fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys’ fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s). In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides’ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.

      The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim, only as permitted by applicable law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by these Terms.  The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief not allowed under these Terms, nor shall the arbitrator have any authority to enter any award that is contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable statute, case law, or constitutional law, nor shall they have any power to modify, change, or excuse performance of any material term of this Agreement.  The arbitrator also may not order any involved BCL Party to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless the involved BCL Party explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.  Further, unless the involved BCL Party expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons’ claims with yours and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.

      You and the BCL Parties agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order. In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, you and the BCL Parties agree that an order confirming award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed.  Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award.  If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.

      If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained.
